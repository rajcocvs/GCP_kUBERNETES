# NEED FOR PVC
# 1. Dynamic volume provisioning allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. 

# 2. Without dynamic provisioning, cluster administrators have to manually 
# make calls to their cloud or storage provider to create new storage 
# volumes, and then create PersistentVolume objects to represent them in k8s

# 3. The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for cluster 
# administrators to pre-provision storage. Instead, it automatically 
# provisions storage when it is requested by users.

# 4. PVC: Users request dynamically provisioned storage by including 
# a storage class in their PersistentVolumeClaim

# Persistent Volume Access Modes
## ReadWriteOnce: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
## ReadOnlyMany: The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.
## ReadWriteMany: 
# 1. The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes. 
# 2. PersistentVolume resources that are backed by Compute Engine persistent disks don't 
#    support this access mode.
